This week we will explore matrilineal societies around the world and how their religion influences their culture. 

When thinking about patriarchy and how it influences our world, it can sometimes seem impossible to imagine an alternate reality where women are seen as powerful. Yet, while they are few, places like this exist in the world. They are known as matrilineal societies. In a matrilineal family system, a person's lineage is traced through their mother's side. Matrilineal systems provide authority to women and here, women are not treated with disrespect. With great value being placed on women in these systems, the matrinieal structure has an essential function on formation of social bonds. (in other words, women are very important to social life and the function of society).
