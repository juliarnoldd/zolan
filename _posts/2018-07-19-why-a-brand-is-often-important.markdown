## Can you imagine a world where women are in control?

### What if I told you that for some, this is a reality.

And no - I'm not talking about the Barbie movie. I am talking about real societies where women are powerful and respected. Places where women are decision makers. 
Have you ever thought about how there are people across the world who live completely different lives than the one you do? 

This question got me thinking about how diverse the world really is and how there must be places out there where women are seen differently than they are here. As someone who has grown up surrounded by a patriarchal society that is so rooted in values and boxes that women are supposed to fit into, it got me thinking about whether those boxes exist everywhere, or if certain societie have a different set of boxes they push onto their own definition of gender roles. This led me to research what I interpreted as the opposite of patriarchy - leading me to discover matriarchal and matrilinieal societies. 

This week we will explore matrilineal societies around the world and how their religion influences their culture. 

When thinking about patriarchy and how it influences our world, it can sometimes seem impossible to imagine an alternate reality where women are seen as powerful. Yet, while they are few, places like this exist in the world. They are known as matrilineal societies. In a matrilineal family system, a person's lineage is traced through their mother's side. Matrilineal systems provide authority to women and here, women are not treated with disrespect. With great value being placed on women in these systems, the matrinieal structure has an essential function on formation of social bonds. (in other words, women are very important to social life and the function of society).
