## Can you imagine a world where women are in control?

### What if I told you that for some, this is a reality.

And no - I'm not talking about the Barbie movie. I am talking about real societies where women are powerful and respected. Places where women are decision makers. 
Have you ever thought about how there are people across the world who live completely different lives than the one you do? 

This question got me thinking about how diverse the world really is and how there must be places out there where women are seen differently than they are here. As someone who has grown up surrounded by a patriarchal society that is so rooted in values and boxes that women are supposed to fit into, it got me thinking about whether those boxes exist everywhere, or if certain societies have a different set of boxes they push onto their own definition of gender roles. This led me wonder - what does the opposite of patriarchy look like? 

What I soon discovered is that it manifests itself in what are known as matriarchal and matrilinieal societies. 

Not sure what that means? Don't worry. This week we will be exploring matrilineal societies around the world and how their religion influences their culture. 

It can sometimes seem impossible to imagine an alternate reality where women are seen as powerful. However, while they are few, places like this do exist in the world. They are known as matrilineal societies. In a matrilineal family system, a person's lineage is traced through their mother's side. Matrilineal systems provide authority to women, creating a culture where women are treated with respect. Even more, with great value being placed on women in these systems, the matrilineal structure has an essential function on the formation of social bonds - or in other words, women are very important to social life and the function of society in these places. 

Doesn't that sound incredible? 

When I was doing my research, there were three societies in particular that caught my eye.

### The Minangkabau, The Mosuo, and The Tuareg

Stay tuned throughout the week as I take you on a journey through faith, exploring the ins and outs of these three complex socities. Maybe we all have something to learn from them :)
