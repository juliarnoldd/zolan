## Matrilineality
### What is it really?
As I previously touched on, matrilineality is a relatively rare social structure that exists in today’s reality. These systems exist throughout different cultural contexts around the world, with each one having distinct social values and religious backgrounds. 

One of the largest matrilineal societies that exists today are the Minangkabau of West Sumatra, Indonesia. 

In my research, there were many aspects of their culture that interested me, and I found that their relationship to the Islamic faith to be very distinctive and unique. In fact, exploring the way they balance Islamic traditions that are predominantly based on patriarchal systems while upholding a matrilineal society that values women and places them at the centre of social life is fascinating. 

Firstly, let’s take a look at the many distinguishing features of the matrilineal system practiced by the Minangkabau:

For one, the maternal line is the one that organizes descent and the formation of ethnic lines – so in other words, kinship systems and family unity is established through the mother’s side.

Additionally, the residence pattern is matrilocal or dwi-local – whereas the family will reside at the wife’s place and at the husband’s parent’s place.

Even further, inheritance plays a large role in the establishment of matrilineality in their culture.

To explain, the distribution of inheritance is organized into two categories: ***pusako tinggi*** and ***pusako randah***.

***Pusako tinggi*** is known as high inheritance. This form is of inheritance is passed down from generation to generation from the Mamak – or mother’s brothers, to their nieces. 

***Pusako randah*** is known as low inheritance. In this system, inheritance is inherited from parents or passed down through grants to children and is divided based on Islamic law. 

The involvement of women in handling inheritance is mandatory and it actually cannot proceed without them. For example, if a husband were to attempt property acquisition, they would not be able to do so without their wife.

### Minangkabau and the power to promote gender equality

Gender equality is something that is seen as more accessible in matrilineal societies. This can be for various reasons, but rests mostly on the importance surrounding women and the value that is placed on them in these societies. When thinking about women in relation to the more mainstream cultural tendencies of other places around the world, women have historically been pushed to the margins. 

What makes places like this so impressive to me is their ability to actively fight the gender norms that plague the rest of the world, and even find a way to balance the expectations of their religious affiliations with the way they believe society should be set up. 

Most importantly, they are not taking away from the importance of men. It has been well documented that men are equally as significant when it comes to customary or familial issues, and their input is still valued. 

Some of the men’s duties include:
-	The paternal figure to his children
-	Fulfilling the duty of a husband, family leader and supervisor
-	Protector and guardian of his sister’s assets 
-	Caring for his sibling’s nephews

Additionally, men take on responsibilities outside the home, including acting as leaders and role models in their daily lives, demonstrating behaviours that align with the teachings of Islam, and exhibiting resourcefulness and intelligence.
