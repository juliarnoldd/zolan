## Matrilineality
### What is it really?
As I previously touched on, matrilineality is a relatively rare social structure that exists in today’s reality. These systems exist throughout different cultural contexts around the world, with each one having distinct social values and religious backgrounds. 

One of the largest matrilineal societies that exists today are the **Minangkabau of West Sumatra, Indonesia**. 

In my research, there were many aspects of their culture that interested me, and I found that their relationship to the Islamic faith to be very distinctive and unique. In fact, exploring the way they balance Islamic traditions that are predominantly based on patriarchal systems while upholding a matrilineal society that values women and places them at the centre of social life is fascinating. 

Firstly, let’s take a look at the many distinguishing features of the matrilineal system practiced by the Minangkabau:

For one, the maternal line is the one that organizes descent and the formation of ethnic lines – so in other words, kinship systems and family units are established through the mother’s side.

Additionally, the residence pattern is matrilocal or dwi-local – whereas the family will reside at the wife’s place and at the husband’s parent’s place.

Even further, inheritance plays a large role in the establishment of matrilineality in their culture.

To explain, the distribution of inheritance is organized into two categories: ***pusako tinggi*** and ***pusako randah***.

***Pusako tinggi*** is known as high inheritance. This form is of inheritance is passed down from generation to generation from the *Mamak* – or mother’s brothers, to their nieces. 

***Pusako randah*** is known as low inheritance. In this system, inheritance is inherited from parents or passed down through grants to children and is divided based on Islamic law. 

The involvement of women in handling inheritance is mandatory and it actually cannot proceed without them. For example, if a husband were to attempt property acquisition, they would not be able to do so without their wife.

### Minangkabau and the power to promote gender equality

Gender equality is something that is seen as more accessible in matrilineal societies. This can be for various reasons, but rests mostly on the importance surrounding women and the value that is placed on them in society. When thinking about women in relation to the more mainstream cultural tendencies of other places around the world, women have historically been pushed to the margins. 

What makes places like this so impressive to me is their ability to actively fight the gender norms that plague the rest of the world, and even find a way to balance the expectations of their religious affiliations with the way they believe society should be set up.

Most importantly, they are not taking away from the importance of men. It has been well documented that men are equally as significant when it comes to customary or familial issues, and their input is still valued. 

Some of the men’s duties include:
-	The paternal figure to his children
-	Fulfilling the duty of a husband, family leader, and supervisor
-	Protector and guardian of his sister’s assets 
-	Caring for his sibling’s nephews

Additionally, men take on responsibilities outside the home, including acting as leaders and role models in their daily lives, demonstrating behaviours that align with the teachings of Islam, and exhibiting resourcefulness and intelligence.

Women, on the other hand, are given the opportunity to have active roles in both domestic and public domains of life in Minangkabau society. Their duties include caring for children, supporting their spouse and their siblings, but also contributing to their family’s financial well-being. 

### What does this all mean in relation to the Islamic faith?

In attempting to gain more knowledge on how gender is approached in Minangkabau culture in relation to their devotion to Islam, I decided to look to *The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Women* to ground my knowledge on the Muslim faith. 

By reading the chapter titled “The Qur’an and Woman,” it became clear to me that gender roles in the Qur’an can be traced back to the understanding of women in relation to men. This text explains that God has intimacy with both men and women, and that female figures like Mary, Bilqis, and Zulaykha demonstrate the importance of women in the Muslim faith.

However, this answer didn’t exactly satisfy me. When thinking about the depiction of women in the Qur’an, I do believe there are examples that demonstrate how they are theoretically equal with men. Yet, after doing my research, it is clear that this is not shown in practice. 

In fact, the treatment of women is often dictated by the interpretation of Allah’s word derived by each individual community. The traditional and conservative notion that women are expected to care for the home and serve not only their children, but their husbands as well, plays a very large role in perpetuating the conceived gender roles that women are supposed to adhere to in Muslim society. 

The Code of Hammurabi is an example of this effect, whereas it allots certain benefits to men and also restricts the rights of women. The rights of Arab women, in practice, are restricted in almost all facets of life. 

In many places they can’t even:

-	Travel freely outside the household
-	Own an ATM card

So, while the Qur’an acknowledges the biological and anatomical differences between men and women, it does not use those characteristics to define the treatment of each gender. The application of gender roles in Muslim society therefore falls onto the **interpretation** of religious teachings – something that has so deeply been engrained into the cultural identity rooted in patriarchy. 

Then, when we think about the Minangkabau and how they maintain a faith rooted in Islamic teaching and the Qur’an, we can simply understand that it is their interpretation of these texts and principles that differ from many other cultural contexts, not the actual Qur’anic teachings themselves. 

These things make you reflect on the nuance of religion, and I hope learning about places like this help you ask important questions about the society around you. We can all make a choice in how we want to interpret our own religiousity, so why not choose one where women are empowered instead of marginalized?
