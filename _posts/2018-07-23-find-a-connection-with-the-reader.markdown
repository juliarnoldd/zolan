Our last stop this week on our exploration of matrilineality takes us to the **Tuareg** people.

Once again, while there can be multiple overarching concepts and aspects of life, this group demonstrates how there is no one stop shop for all things matrilineal.

The Tuareg are their own distinct people, with a rich history that is complicated and complex.

## Who Are They? ##

With a vast population of roughly 2 million, the Tuareg are a nomadic people located throughout the Sahara. They stretch from southwestern Libya to Southern Algeria, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and even the far North of Nigeria. 

While there are many societies that make up the Tuareg people, what we see is that as tribes developed through time, some remained matrilineal while some adopted paternal succession. 

We will be discussing the origins and focusing on those that remained matrilineal. However, as they are the majority, we won’t be focusing on the specific names of the clans. 

Firstly, the Tuareg are primarily comprised of those who follow a Muslim faith, yet they have a rich history of practicing matrilineality, something that differs from their Arab counterparts. 

Traditionally, Tuareg women have played prominent roles in social life and were responsible for the affairs of their camp. This included owning livestock, managing goat herds, educating children, preparing food, and many other aspects of organization. They also knew freedom when it came to love and marriage – a stark difference compared to other Arab women.

What’s more is that Tuareg women were poets and musicians. This is something that is not often acknowledged when thinking about the dimensions of women and their roles in life. Tuareg women would compose and record songs, even drawing in men from different villages to come watch their performances. 

Another important element of Tuareg life that demonstrates a shift in societal standards is the wearing of the veil. In Tuareg society, it is men who are known to wear the veil and women who do not. 

Although, when we get to the aspect of rights of succession, we start to see common matrilineal themes emerge. 

In traditional Tuareg society, the following rights were transmitted – and were done so by matrilineal descent. 

-	Group membership
-	Succession to political office
-	Access to land rights
-	Inheritance of property and residency

However, what differs from other matrilineal societies is that it is still men who are mainly in charge of these things, and the right to succeed is transmitted alphabetically through the line of brothers. This passes down then to mother’s sister’s sons and ultimately to the sister’s sons. 

Still with me?

In this sense, we see a stark shift from those like the Mosuo who have women in control of things like land and money.

In fact, in Tuareg society, wealth is delineated according to Quranic law. This means that while they recognize the right of women to inherit, they primarily direct it towards males using the patrilineal line. An example of this would be a daughter receiving one share of inheritance while a son receives twice as much. 

## A Different Form of Matriline ##

With this is mind, let’s refer back to our discussion about the Minangkabau and their interpretation of the Muslim faith. In their society, they use Qur’anic principles, however they choose to interpret the teachings in different ways than those of the patriarchal standard. 

We see a version of that here.

You see, the Tuareg, on the other hand, observe a different kind of matrilineality whereas women have freedoms that other Arab women do not have. They regard themselves as men’s equals, marry at will, serve as the heads of their camps, and speak in council. They are allowed to go when and where they please, they can teach, have property, and run the home.

Yet, they have never had access to direct power under the Islamic faith. Abiding by some patriarchal aspects of the Qur’an, they observe a combination of male authority with the freedoms allowed to women. This is most evident by considering that women can take part in tribal decision-making, but they ultimately can’t be leaders.
