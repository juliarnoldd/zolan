Hi friends, continuing on with our discussion about Matrilineal societies, today we have the privilege of exploring the intricacies of the **Mosuo people of China**. 

## The Kingdom of Women ##

Isolated from other civilisation, the Mosuo people live on the banks of Lugu Lake in China – a remote region that is a 6 hour drive from the nearest city. Impressively, this tribe has existed for thousands of years and has even been dubbed the **Kingdom of Women** by the rest of China. They have defied all odds and existed as a strictly matrilineal over time.

It is remarkable to think about is how a system like this can still exist in a land where patriarchy is rooted so deep that a male-dominated mentality has taken over and produced a skewed birth rate of roughly 120 boys to 100 girls in today’s age.

As we saw with the Minangkabau people, there are certain qualities that define each matrilineal society. For the Mosuo, they have a distinct practice surrounding children and relationships. In fact, while in many countries around the world the practice of monogamy is the standard, that is not the case for the Mosuo.

### Walking Marriages ###

They practice what are known as walking marriages, whereas Mosuo females can choose their lovers and have as many or as few as they want in their lifetime. They do not have any words equivalent to *husband* or *father* like we have in english terms. Instead, if they decide to have a long-term partner (that is by no means permanent), they are known as *axias*. These men will fish, take care of animals, and care for their own families before going to visit their women (and sometimes children) at nighttime. They are allowed to visit women for a night of pleasure, but then are expected to leave in the morning. 

On top of that, babies are reared exclusively in the woman’s family as men are not expected to support their children. In fact, it is not uncommon for children to be unaware of who their father is. 

These facets of Mosuo life are often what grabs the attention of the public as it is so different from what most of the world is used to.

However, there are other defining qualities of matrilineal life practiced by the Mosuo. 

Some examples include:

-	Overseeing the majority of important family and social decisions
-	Being in charge of household finances
-	Owning land and property
-	Having full rights to their children

The benefits of matrilineality manifests itself in different ways. For example, one study done on both the matrinileal Mosuo and the patrilineal Mosuo demonstrates how women in matrilineal society are more educated than their patrilineal counterparts. On top of that, their friendship networks were more connected, and included many more cross-gender friendships than the women of the patrilineal Mosuo. These friendships may reflect the greater value placed on women in matrilineal societies, where men are raised to view women as equals rather than as inferior.
