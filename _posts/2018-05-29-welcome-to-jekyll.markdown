Hi friends!

Continuing on with our discussion about Matrilineal societies, today we have the privilege of exploring the intricacies of the **Mosuo people of China**. 

## The Kingdom of Women ##

Isolated from other civilisation, the Mosuo people live on the banks of Lugu Lake in China – a remote region that is a 6 hour drive from the nearest city. Impressively, they have defied all odds and existed as a strictly matrillineal society for thousands of years, being rightfully dubbed the **Kingdom of Women** by the rest of China.

It is remarkable to think about is how a system like this can still exist in a land where patriarchy is rooted so deep that a male-dominated mentality has taken over and produced a skewed birth rate of roughly 120 boys to 100 girls in today’s age.

As we saw with the Minangkabau people, there are certain qualities that define each matrilineal society. For the Mosuo, they have a distinct practice surrounding children and relationships. In fact, while in many countries around the world the practice of monogamy is the standard, that is not the case for the Mosuo.

### Walking Marriages ###

The Mosuo practice what are known as walking marriages, whereas Mosuo females can choose their lovers and have as many or as few as they want in their lifetime. They do not have any words equivalent to *husband* or *father* like we have in english terms. Instead, if they decide to have a long-term partner (that is by no means permanent), they are known as *axias*. These men will fish, take care of animals, and care for their own families before going to visit their women (and sometimes children) at nighttime. They are allowed to visit women for a night of pleasure, but then are expected to leave in the morning.

On top of that, babies are reared exclusively in the woman’s family as men are not expected to support their children. In fact, it is not uncommon for children to be unaware of who their father is. 

These facets of Mosuo life are often what grabs the attention of the public as it is so different from what most of the world is used to.

However, there are other defining qualities of matrilineal life practiced by Mosuo women. 

Some examples include:

-	Overseeing the majority of important family and social decisions
-	Being in charge of household finances
-	Owning land and property
-	Having full rights to their children

These practices can be seen as unique to Westerner eyes, but also in the eyes of those who practice the same religion.
To explain, the Mosuo follow two religions – **Tibetan Buddhism and Daba** – their native religion involving animism and ancestor worship.
Tibetan Buddhism is by far the predominant religion practiced by the Mosuo people, with Daba coming into play primarily for the maintenance of Mosuo culture and language. 

### Religion their own way ###

What's interesting is that historically, studies have shown that in Tibetan Buddhism is primarily based on patriarchal societal norms. These societal norms include a lack of control for women in many spheres of life, with aspects like hierarchal structure prevailing – meaning that monks ultimately have more authority than nuns. 

Other themes frequently described by women are:
-	Bodily Suffering
-	Domestic responsibilities
-	Struggles to assert agency

Therefore, while Tibetan Buddhism is practiced by the Mosuo, with women carrying Buddhist prayer wheels, Buddhist monks walking the streets, and even homes containing a statue of a Buddhist God above the cooking fire, this society approaches religious life with a more egalitarian view.

This can be seen in many ways around Mosuo society, with women having economic independence, control over property and wealth, and even personal autonomy in choosing a partner as marriage is not pressured upon them. They also hold more central roles in religious and spiritual practices – something that is traditionally reserved for monks.

And so, we see resistance to traditional gender roles in Mosuo society through their ability to empower women. While they do engage in Tibetan Buddhist traditions, their ability to maintain their own customs of women in control over family structures, property, and spiritual practices, shows their strength in community values and is a clear representation of why they have survived for so long
