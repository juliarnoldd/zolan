Hi everyone and welcome to Faith Across Cultures. My name is Silo Fehr and I created this blog as a space to dive deeper into faith and religion, looking at how spirituality can connect people from around the world. Each week we will explore a new topic as I look to learn with you and grow. Join me as we explore what this beautiful world has to offer :)
