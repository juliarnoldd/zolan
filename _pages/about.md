Hi everyone and welcome to Faith Across Cultures. My name is Silo Fehr and I created this blog as a space to dive deeper into faith and religion, looking at how spirituality can connect people from around the world. 

As a 20-something woman who has grown up in Western society, I want to challenge myself to look beyond religious practices and cultures that I have experienced firsthand. I want to learn about those who may exist in small corners of the world, or explore the intricacies of those religions I already think I know about. The way I see it, simply keeping an open mind can take you further than you ever expected to go. 

Each week we will explore a new topic as I look to learn with you and grow. I hope you will join me as we explore what this beautiful world has to offer :)
